# Hi! I'm Kyla. ü§ô
I like to brag that I am originally from Hawaii. I believe my diverse background and love for the arts has driven me to the UX field, where I plan to spread ‚ÄúAloha‚Äù by exuding positive vibes and an exemplary mindset. My user-driven design, and advocative approach to technology allows me to create thoughtful user experiences. While discovering my passion for User Experience design, I was afforded the opportunity to study Web Development. I think it's really cool that not only am I able to speak for the user, but I am also able to implement my discoveries as a Full Stack Developer.

## Making the internet "feel" better.
In my past life(still practicing when allowed the opportunity) I was a tattoo artist of 10 years practicing, and a sip üç∑ and paint üé® instructor. I think these fields have given me the opportunity to get to know people on a different level. Communication, along with being confident in your skills üí™, was key to being successful. In both fields, I often had to comfort the client and help them get through whatever may be causing them distress(paint from tattooing or a mistake a painter made). This helped me to hone in my empathy skills. I practice the communication skills I've learned to become a better teammate. I use my knowledge and understanding of humans that I've gained over the last decade to help me be a better human, UX designer, and developer. I believe my past experience has put me on a quest to help make the internet just a little more people friendly.
